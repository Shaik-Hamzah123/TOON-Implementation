This session is for anyone who wants to make artificial intelligence more practical and less expensive. As the computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to grow, their deployment challenges in terms of cost, energy consumption, and hardware requirements become increasingly significant. This session aims to address these challenges by exploring a range of effective model compression techniques that reduce the size and computational overhead of LLMs without compromising their performance. In this presentation, we will touch base the following High-Level Concepts of LLM Compression 1. Pruning: Technique to remove redundant or less important parameters from the model. 2. Knowledge Distillation: Training a smaller model (student) to replicate the behavior of a larger model (teacher). 3. Low-Rank Factorization: Decomposing large weight matrices into products of smaller matrices, reducing the number of parameters and computations. 4. Quantization: Reducing the precision of the model parameters. Join us to explore simple, effective ways to reduce the size of these models using techniques like pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and low-rank factorization. We'll break down each method in easy-to-understand terms and infographics, explaining what these techniques do, why they are beneficial, what are different categories under each one of them and how they can be applied in real-life scenarios.\",\n",

We begin by analyzing the current plateau in prompt engineering, where simple prompt tweaks deliver only short-term, brittle solutions that don’t scale to complex or long-term objectives. The session explains why post-training is regaining importance, driven by the democratization of fine-tuning pipelines and reward-model toolkits. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in critical real-world applications, we need robust, policy-driven alignment methods that can go beyond input tweaking and deliver reliable, safe behavior at scale. We introduce new paradigms such as leveraging test-time computation for improved policy learning and demonstrate how integrating tool use with reinforcement learning (RL) leads to better, more capable agents. We will detail the challenges in this transition and highlight the opportunities it unlocks for both research and industrial deployment. Attendees will see practical applications such as fine-tuning LLMs to adhere to organization-specific policies, including regulatory compliance in sectors like Indian finance or healthcare. The session will also demonstrate how reward models and verifiable rewards can teach agents complex multi-step tasks, like support automation or conversational assistants that reason over extensive documents. Furthermore, we will explore integrating external tools-such as calculators, code execution, and web search-with LLMs using RL to enhance capabilities in areas like customer support, education, and data analytics. A live code demo will specifically illustrate how to train an LLM to properly invoke external APIs or tools, such as weather or web search functions, showcasing RL for tool use in action.\",\n",

In deep research, these systems can assist in navigating vast amounts of information and synthesizing insights. For consumers, they can facilitate complex planning, such as organizing intricate travel itineraries or guiding high-value purchases by providing structured information and suggestions.

Pipecat is an open-source Python framework for building real-time voice and multimodal conversational agents. You'll learn how to design, implement, and deploy a voice-powered system capable of handling patient appointment scheduling, answering common medical queries, and intelligently escalating complex issues to a supervisor (either a secondary voice-agent or a human). The session will begin with an introduction to PipeCat and Voice AI Fundamentals, explaining how PipeCat orchestrates speech-to-speech pipelines by layering LLM-driven logic on top of telephony transports like Twilio or WebRTC. We will demonstrate how PipeCat handles latency, interruption management, and context tracking effectively. The workshop will then delve into building a healthcare booking and support workflow, showing how to capture patient speech, transcribe it, invoke LLM function calls to backend appointment-booking APIs, and synthesize audio replies. You'll also learn how to embed domain-specific knowledge (e.g., clinic hours, insurance policies) into prompt templates for efficient FAQ answering. We will then cover designing multiple voice personalities and supervision logic, including configuring distinct TTS voices (e.g., a friendly \\\"Receptionist\\\" and a formal \\\"Supervisor\\\" voice for escalations). You'll discover how PipeCat simplifies switching personalities based on sentiment or intent detection, and how to route calls to a live human agent when needed. Finally, we will discuss scaling and deploying your contact center, outlining best practices for horizontal scaling through containerizing PipeCat workers, configuring autoscaling groups, monitoring per-minute costs of STT/TTS/LLM calls, and implementing caching or context summarization to reduce expensive long-session inference, ensuring sub-second voice-to-voice latency even under heavy load. The practical applications covered will include automated appointment booking, where we'll build a PipeCat handler that transcribes patient speech, extracts entities via an LLM function call, and interacts with a REST API to check slot availability, confirming appointments with synthesized TTS responses. We will also demonstrate how to answer insurance and billing queries by embedding a small knowledge base of insurance coverage rules and matching queries to preloaded FAQ text or LLM prompts to synthesize confident audio replies based on clinic policy tables. Furthermore, we will configure dynamic personality switching and escalation, setting up two TTS voices (\\\"Front Desk\\\" and \\\"Supervisor\\\") and illustrating how PipeCat triggers a personality switch based on sentiment analysis, flagging emergencies or complex issues and either engaging another PipeCat instance or bridging the call to a live human operator.\",\n",
